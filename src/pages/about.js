                  A computer science student who passionate in the web
                  development. I started my learning journey in web development
                  from front-end development. Started from the most basic
                  front-end aspects, until utilizing the most popular front-end
                  framework named React JS, which is used by big companies like
                  Facebook,Instagram,Traveloka,Tokopedia, and many more. I then
                  continue to learn GraphQL, a query language for API, which
                  maybe replacing REST API in the future. My learning journey in
                  web development doesnâ€™t stop there, I then continue to learn
                  back-end as well, which is the node JS with express & mongoDB
                  to create a web server API. I learn both front-end and
                  back-end because I am really thrilled to be able to make my
                  own application.
                </p>

                <p className="paragraph">
                  I have committed myself to never stop learning, because I
                  believe that web development is always advancing, if I stop
                  learning, that means I will be left behind with the current
                  web technologies.
